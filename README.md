# challenge-one

## Description
My motivation for this project is to make a codebase that follows accessibility standards for a website that Horiseon, a Social Media Marketing Agency would like. First, I changed the title of the website so that it is more descriptive and so their site is optimized for search engines, I then added alt attributes to all of the images, I also made the headings all fall into order.
